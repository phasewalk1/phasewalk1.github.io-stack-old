# Overview
> My personal site
## Scope
I mainly write about free software, mathematics, cryptography, and the philosophy of computation, which I use as an umbrella term for all things cypherpunkian, transhumanist, network spiritual, etc. 
Though sometimes, I may write about things only tangentially adjacent (or peripherally related) to the above. I also maintain a list of resources I find to be helpful, neat, and important, those can 
be found [here](https://phasewalk1.github.io/resource).
## Styling
This static Hugo blog is using the [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) theme, by [CaiJimmy](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/), and was bootstrapped using the starter site, 
[here](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack-starter). Thank you to Cai (and contributors) for this beautiful theme!
