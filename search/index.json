[{"content":" From Dan Boneh\u0026rsquo;s Cryptography I and the MoonMath Manual, to ZK Hack\u0026rsquo;s Whiteboard Sessions; and soon, the Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge book by Justin Thaler. Many topics I have taken notes for already are not yet included here, as I am working on sectioning it in such a way that the material flows more intuitively; In other words, expect many changes to this document in the future.\nIntroduction Cryptography is everywhere. From securing communications (HTTPS, SSL/TLS, WPA, etc.) to encrypting sensitive, persisted files, cryptography is a tremendous tool, and forms the basis for many security mechanisms. Cryptography is not the solution to all security problems, it is not reliable if used incorrectly, and it is not something you should try to invent yourself (there are many examples of broken adhoc designs, and this is why we use the phrase \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t roll your own crypto!\u0026rdquo;).\nSome Notes on Notation Discrete Notation There are a few notational concepts that show up a lot in the following material. Some people may be familiar with these already, and others may not be. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d write some notes on them here so the following material is more easily accessible for those who may not have studied Discrete Math yet.\nWe use the symbol $\\forall$ to denote the concept of \u0026ldquo;for all\u0026rdquo;, and the symbol $\\in$ denotes the concept \u0026ldquo;in\u0026rdquo;. We often combine these symbols to make statements such as, for all $x$ in the set $X$, which we could explicitly write as $$\\forall x\\in X$$\nIt is also useful to discuss the existence of arbitrary values. For this, we use the $\\exists$ symbol.\n$$\\exists x\\in X\\implies\\text{there exists an }x\\text{ in }X$$ $$\\nexists x\\in X\\implies\\text{there does not exist an }x\\text{ in }X$$\nAnother concept we like to represent through notation is the phrase \u0026ldquo;such that\u0026rdquo;, this allows us to restrict certain sets of values to abiding by an arbitrary property. Consider the case in which we\u0026rsquo;d like to discuss the set of all ordered-pairs in $X$ such that no pair contains two of the same values, we may write this as $$\\lbrace(x,y)\\in X\\space|\\space x\\ne y\\rbrace$$\nCombining the above concepts, you should feel comfortable reading expressions like\n$$\\forall x\\in X,\\exists y\\in Y\\space|\\space f(x)=y$$\nFunctional Notation When discussing functions, it is useful to be able to relate them to their domain and codomain. This allows us to clearly state the set of all inputs the function can accept, and the set of all outputs the function can generate. We use the notation $$f:X\\rightarrow Y$$ to show that $f$ is a function that accepts inputs from the set $X$ and maps them to outputs in the set $Y$.\nCiphers A cipher is a pair of efficient* algorithms $(E,D)$ that are defined over a keyspace $\\mathcal K$, a message space $\\mathcal M$, and a cipher space $\\mathcal C$. For convenience, we say that a cipher is defined over $(\\mathcal K,\\mathcal M,\\mathcal C)$, where $$E:\\mathcal K\\times\\mathcal M\\rightarrow\\mathcal C$$ $$D:\\mathcal K\\times\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathcal M$$ such that for all messages $m$ in the message space ($\\forall m\\in\\mathcal M$), and for all keys $k$ in the keyspace, $$D(k,E(k,m))=m$$\nDiscrete Probability Universe Discrete probability is defined over a universe, denoted \\(U\\). The universe is a finite set, and very commonly, simply the set of all \\(n\\)-bit strings, $$U=\\lbrace 0,1 \\rbrace^n.$$ It then follows that \\(U\\) has \\(2^n\\) elements, or, we could say that the cardinality of the universe \\(U\\) as defined above, is \\(2^n\\), and denote it as $|U|$. For example, the universe \\(U=\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace^2\\) is the set of all \\(2\\)-bit strings, e.g., \\(\\lbrace 00,01,10,11 \\rbrace\\).\nProbability Distributions A probability distribution \\(Pr\\) over a universe \\(U\\) is a function \\(Pr:U\\rightarrow[0,1]\\) such that $$\\sum_{x\\in U}Pr(x)=1.$$ To say this less formally, we could say that \\(Pr\\) is a function that maps an input \\(x\\in U\\) to a value ranging from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\), in such a way that the summation of all the images of \\(Pr\\) equals \\(1\\).\nUniform Distribution A uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely. $$\\forall x\\in U,Pr(x)=\\frac{1}{|U|}$$\nEvents An event is a subset of a universe and is to be understood as something that might or might not happen. Intuitively, when dealing with probabilities, we are considering the likelihood of certain outcomes. Each of these potential outcomes, or collections of outcomes, is called an event. The probability of an event $A\\subseteq U$ occuring is $$Pr(A)=\\sum_{x\\in A}Pr(x)\\quad\\in[0,1]$$\nTo say this less formally, the probability of an event $A$ occuring, $Pr(A)$, is the sum of all the probabilities of the individual outcomes that make up $A$. To illustrate this, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss an example. Suppose $U$ is the set of all outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die, i.e., $U=\\lbrace1,2,3,4,5,6\\rbrace$. If you consider the event $A$ as rolling an even number, then $A=\\lbrace2,4,6\\rbrace$. In a uniform distribution (like a fair die), the probability of each outcome is $\\frac{1}{|U|}=\\frac{1}{6}$. To find $Pr(A)$, you would sum up the probabilities of the individual outcomes in $A$: $$Pr(A)=Pr(2)+Pr(4)+Pr(6)=\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}$$\nDistribution Vector Let \\(|U|=n\\) be the cardinality of a universe \\(U\\). Because \\(U\\) is a finite set, we can represent the distribution of every element in \\(U\\) by storing the weights that the distribution assigns to every element in \\(U\\) as an \\(n\\)-vector: $$\\begin{bmatrix} Pr(x_0) \\\\ Pr(x_1) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Pr(x_n) \\end{bmatrix}$$\nRandom Variables A random variable is a function that maps outcomes of random processes (like a coin flip, or the roll of a die) to numerical values. In other words, it assigns a value to each possible outcome of a random experiment or sample.\nFormally, if $U$ is the universe of all possible outcomes of a certain random experiment, then a random variable $x$ is defined as\n$$x:U\\rightarrow V$$ where $V$ is the set in which $x$ takes its values.\nUniform Random Variable A random variable is said to be uniformly distributed if all the values in its range have an equal likelihood of occuring. Explicitly, let \\(U=\\lbrace 0,1 \\rbrace^n\\) be some universe. We write \\(r\\xleftarrow{R}U\\) to denote a uniform random variable over \\(U\\), where $$\\forall a\\in U,\\quad Pr[r=a]=\\frac{1}{||U||}.$$\nXOR It is said that all cryptographers do is compute XORs in various ways, and there is some truth to that, so what is XOR?\nXOR, or exclusive or, is a bitwise operator, i.e., it operates on sets of bits $\\lbrace0,1\\rbrace^n$. XOR can be thought of as a modification of the OR operator, so to better understand it, let\u0026rsquo;s review the behavior of OR.\nThe way OR works is intuitive. What it does is essentially, for every two bits $a_i,b_i$, it asks is one OR the other equal to $1$. Taking the OR of $1$ and $0$ outputs $1$, taking the OR of $1$ and $1$ outputs $1$, but the OR of $0$ and $0$ outputs $0$, since neither of the bits are $1$. So, $$\\lbrace1,1,1,0\\rbrace$$ $$\\text{ OR }$$ $$\\lbrace0,1,1,1\\rbrace$$ $$\\text{yields }\\lbrace1,1,1,1\\rbrace$$\nThe difference with XOR is it\u0026rsquo;s exclusive, meaning it must be one or the other, but not both. $$\\lbrace1,1,1,0\\rbrace$$ $$\\text{ XOR }$$ $$\\lbrace0,1,1,1\\rbrace$$ $$\\text{yields }\\lbrace1,0,0,1\\rbrace$$ Also, note that, in the following material, we use the symbol $\\oplus$ to denote the bitwise XOR operator.\nInformation Theoretics Perfect Secrecy Let \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) be the keyspace, \\(\\mathcal M\\) be the message space, and \\(\\mathcal C\\) be the cipher space. A cipher \\((E,D)\\) over \\((\\mathcal K,\\mathcal M,\\mathcal C)\\) has perfect secrecy if $$\\forall m_0,m_1\\in\\mathcal M,\\quad ||m_0||=||m_1||,$$ where \\(||m_0||\\) denotes the_length of \\(m_0\\), and $$\\forall c\\in\\mathcal C,\\quad\\text{Pr}[(E(k,m_0)=c)]=\\text{Pr}[(E(k,m_1)=c)],$$ where \\(k\\) is uniform and random in \\(\\mathcal K\\), i.e., \\(k\\xleftarrow{R}\\mathcal K\\). In other words, \\((E,D)\\) has perfect secrecy if for every message \\(m_1,m_2\\) in the message space \\(\\mathcal M\\), the length of \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the same, and additionality, the probability that the ciphertext \\(c\\) came from \\(m_0\\) is equal to the probability that it came from \\(m_1\\).\nSymmetric Encryption Systems Symmetric encryption systems form the building blocks for many modern cryptographic protocols. In a symmetric encryption system, there are two algorithms,\n$E$: encryption algorithm, and $D$: the decryption algorithm important! $D$ is publicly known: never use a proprietary cipher! It is called symmetric encryption because the two parties, Alice and Bob, share a secret key $k$.\nOne Time Pad The One Time Pad is a simple symmetric encryption scheme that is a good starting point in our studies, due to its simplicity. Let $\\mathcal M=\\mathcal K=\\mathcal C=\\lbrace0,1\\rbrace^n$ and $\\forall m\\in\\mathcal M$ and $k\\in\\mathcal K$, $|m|=|k|$. We define the encryption and decryption algorithms as\n$$E(k,m)=k\\oplus m$$ $$D(k,c)=k\\oplus c$$\nPolynomials Polynomials are algebraic expressions composed of variables, commonly referred to as indeterminates, and coefficients. These coefficients function to scale the indeterminates and must be uniformly categorized, meaning they should all belong to a specific number set, such as integers or rational numbers.\nTerminology Univariate polynomials are polynomials of one variable. More precisely,\n$$P(x)=\\sum_{j=0}^m a_jx^j=a_mx^m+a_{m-1}x^{m-1}+\u0026hellip;+a_1x+a_0,$$\nwhere \\(a_j,\u0026hellip;,a_1\\) are the coefficients, and \\(x\\) is the variable. If we let \\(R\\) denote the type of the coefficients (e.g., rational, real, integer), then the set of all univariate polynomials with coefficients in \\(R\\) is denoted \\(R[x]\\).\nZero Polynomial\nThe zero polynomial is a polynomial in which all the coefficients are \\(0\\).\nOne Polynomial\nA polynomial is called the one polynomial if it is a zero polynomial with the constant term (\\(a_0\\) above) of \\(1\\).\nLeading Coefficient\nThe leading coefficient is the the coefficient of the term with the highest degree. We denote it as follows, $$Lc(P)=a_m$$\nNotation Degree-bounded Sets of Polynomials It is useful to look at sets of polynomial w.r.t. their degree. If we, for instance, say \\(m\\) is the maximum degree allowed, we\u0026rsquo;d denote this set as \\(R^{\\le m}[x]\\).\nSome other notations put the bound in the subscript, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s cleaner as a superscript; helps me remember that it\u0026rsquo;s a degree bound and not some sort of indexing.\nPolynomial Arithmetic \u0026ldquo;Polynomials behave like integers in many ways. In particular, they can be added, subtracted and multiplied. In addition, they have their own notion of Euclidean Division. Informally speaking, we can add two polynomials by simply adding the coefficients of the same index, and we can multiply them by applying the distributive property, that is, by multiplying every term of the left factor with every term of the right factor and adding the results together.\u0026rdquo;\nMore formally, let \\(P(x),R(x)\\in R[x]\\) be polynomials with \\(P(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{m_1}a_nx^n\\) and \\(R(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{m_2}b_nx^n\\). Then the sum of these polynomials is\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{m_1}a_nx^n+\\sum_{n=0}^{m_2}b_nx^n\\implies\\sum_{n=0}^{\\textbf{max}(m_1,m_2)}(a_n+b_n)x^n,$$\nwhile the product is defined as\n$$\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{m_1}a_nx^n\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{m_2}b_nx^n\\right)\\implies\\sum_{n=0}^{m_1+m_2}\\sum_{i=0}^n a_ib_{n-i}x^n.$$\nExample 22: MoonMath Manual\nTo give an example of how polynomial arithmetic works, consider the following two integer polynomials \\(P,Q\\in\\mathbb Z[x]\\) with \\(P(x)=5x^2-4x+2\\) and \\(Q(x)=x^3-2x^2+5\\). The sum of these two polynomials is computed by adding the coefficients of each term with equal exponent in \\(x\\) (Eq. 2). This yields the following: $$\\begin{align*} (P+Q)(x) \u0026amp;= (0+1)x^3+(5-2)x^2+(-4+0)x+(2+5) \\\\ \u0026amp;= x^3+3x^2-4x+7. \\end{align*}$$ The product \\(P\\cdot Q\\) is computed by multiplying each term in the first factor with each term in the second factor (Eq. 3). We get the following: \\begin{align} (P\\cdot Q)(x) \u0026amp;= (5x^2-4x+2)\\cdot(x^3-2x^2+5) \\\\ \u0026amp;= (5x^5-10x^4+25x^2)+(-4x^4+8x^3-20x)+(2x^3-4x^2+10) \\\\ \u0026amp;= 5x^5-14x^4+10x^3+21x^2-20x+10. \\end{align}\nLagrange Interpolation A neat thing about polynomials is that, for a polynomial \\(P\\) of degree \\(m\\), \\(P\\) is completely determined by its evaluation on \\(m+1\\) points. An important observation from this is that we can uniquely derive a polynomial of degree \\(m\\) from a set \\(S\\), where $$S=\\lbrace(x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1),\u0026hellip;,(x_m,y_m)\\space|\\space x_i\\ne x_j\\text{ for all indices }i\\text{ and }j\\rbrace.$$\nIn other words, polynomials have the property that given \\(m+1\\) pairs of points \\(x_i,y_i\\) for \\(x_i\\ne x_j\\) are enough to determine the set of pairs \\((x,P(x)),\\space\\forall x\\in R\\).\n*Important If you want to find a polynomial that fits a given set of points\u0026ndash;and if its coefficients have a multiplicative inverse\u0026ndash;you can use the Lagrange Interpolation method. This technique allows you to derive a polynomial \\(P\\) of degree \\(m\\) where \\(P(x_i)=y_i,\\space\\forall (x_i,y_i)\\in S\\).\nAlgorithm: Lagrange Interpolation Finite (Galois) Fields Finite fields are used extensively in modern cryptography. This is due to them possessing characteristics that make performing certain operations within them easy. But what even is a field? Why do we restrict them to being finite? What\u0026rsquo;s useful about them?\nOn Terminology The term Finite Field is sometimes referred to as a Galois Field, after Évariste Galois; a french mathematician who made enormous contributions to mathematics in his short 20 year life.\nThese terms are interchangable, though we will opt to use the term Galois Field (GF) in what follows to give credit where credit is due.\nFields The term field is just a fancy way of denoting a set on which the ordinary operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined. In fact, you are already familiar with (at least) a couple fields! For instance, the set of all real numbers \\(\\mathbb R\\) forms a field; and likewise, so does the set of all rational numbers, \\(\\mathbb Q\\). These operations are undoubtably defined on these sets, so we call them fields.\nSo why doesn\u0026rsquo;t the set of integers \\(\\mathbb Z\\) constitue a field? Well, more formally\u0026ndash;to be classified as a field\u0026ndash;the set must satisfy the following properties:\nAssociativity of addition and multiplication \\(\\forall a,b,c\\in\\mathbb F\\): $$a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$$ $$a\\cdot(b\\cdot c)=(a\\cdot b)\\cdot c$$ Commutativity of addition and multiplication \\(\\forall a,b,c\\in\\mathbb F\\): $$a+b=b+a$$ $$a\\cdot b=b\\cdot a$$ Left-distributivity \\(\\forall a,b,c\\in\\mathbb F\\) $$a\\cdot(b+c)=a\\cdot b+a\\cdot c$$ Existence of additive identity \\(\\exists i\\in\\mathbb F\\) such that $$\\forall a\\in\\mathbb F,\\quad a+i=a$$ Existence of a multiplicative identity \\(\\exists e\\in\\mathbb F\\) such that \\(e\\ne0\\) and $$\\forall a\\in\\mathbb F,\\quad ae=a$$ Existence of additive inverse (often denoted as \\(-a\\)) \\(\\forall a\\in\\mathbb F,\\exists b\\in\\mathbb F\\) such that $$a+b=0$$ Existence of multiplicative inverse (often denoted as \\(a^{-1}\\)) \\(\\forall a\\in\\mathbb F\\) where \\(a\\ne0\\), \\(\\exists b\\in\\mathbb F\\) such that $$a\\cdot b=1$$ We can pretty clearly see that \\(\\mathbb Z\\) satisfies most of these properties. But it is missing one important one: existence of a multiplicative inverse. Because \\(\\mathbb Z\\) is restricted to only whole numbers, it\u0026rsquo;s trivial to see that \\(\\mathbb Z\\) does not satisfy this property, and therfore, does not constitue a field.\n","date":"2023-10-16T20:45:33-07:00","image":"https://phasewalk1.github.io/p/the-cypherpunks-notes/cover_hu60c04c1caafeb9beef77b33c4b66aefc_4017652_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://phasewalk1.github.io/p/the-cypherpunks-notes/","title":"The Cypherpunk's Notes"},{"content":"One mustn’t look around at the current landscape and feel contentment.
