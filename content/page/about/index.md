# TLDR
21 y.o. Fullstack Engineer from the East Bay, California. Passionate about all things computation: *Cryptography*, *AI*, *Scientific Computing*, and more. I'm a privacy advocate, and a transhumanist techno-optimist. 

# Introduction
Hi, my name is **phasewalk1** and I study **Mathematical Computation Theory** -- at the time of writing this I'm finishing up Differential Equations at Diablo Valley College, and will soon be transferring to either UC Santa Cruz or UC Davis, where I plan on participating in undergraduate research. I began my schooling studying applied mathematics, then shortly after shifted to computer science. I took my undergraguate CS courses in C++ and learned Python in my free time. By the time I completed Data Structures/Algorithms and Assembly Programming I was beginning to seek connections online with other programmers. It was then that I went down the rabbit hole of Twitter, 4chan, lainchan, and other online communities.

These communities opened a new world to me. One that shifted my perspective on programming from being a purely pragmatic pursuit to a more philosophical one. Writings such as Erich Hughes' [Cypherpunk Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html), and Aaron Swartz's [Guerilla Open Access](https://archive.org/details/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/mode/2up?view=theater) greatly influenced me to think deeper about the implications of my studies.

It was people like Swartz and Hughes that made me realize that I wanted to be a part of something bigger than myself. I wanted to contribute to the world in a meaningful way. I wanted to make an impact. I wanted to be a part of the solution. I wanted to be a part of the revolution ... 

So I shifted my focus away from slinging code for money and instead began to study the theory of computation. I wanted to understand the fundamentals, and how they can be applied to solve real world problems. My biggest passions lay in Cryptography, Privacy, and Security. I'm also interested in Machine Learning, Abstract Algebra, and Transhumanist Philosophy, but I'll save those for another time.

My heart beats for the future, and I'm excited to see what it holds.
