## Preface

I was introduced to video games when I was very young--I had an older brother. At this age, interacting within them, there were times I was so immersed in the characters on the screen I couldn't tell that there were _characters_. It felt like, a friend--_my_ character, a clone--a two-party match of agency. Not that I thought philosophically of it at that time, but I do remember thinking about the implications of cloning myself. Probably most people have wished they could clone themselves at one point or another, if not to get out of school or some other responsibility. As I've grown older I still think about these implications, though back then I was only considering the biological method of cloning; Now I seriously consider the possibility of replicating minds on silicon.

What follows is a short thought piece on **uploads**, the extension of one's mind onto the digital plane. Importantly, it does not focus too much on _cloning_, rather, on digital immortality.

## Minds

* Short outline of history of human understanding of our own brains, up to the current model of neural networks and how they correspond to our brain structure.

## Matrix Multiplication

* How we build neural networks, how this concept directly maps onto our own minds, etc., example, with illustration

## Serialize

* How do we, well, upload? What does it mean to serialize a mind, encrypt a mind, where do we get uploaded to--who hosts us?

## Networks

* Short outline of history of networked computing to internet--what does it mean to be _online_? Must we upload online, or can we "self-host"? Could we get the benefit of networking with others while also self hosting?

## Autonomy

* How can the person who uploaded remain autonomous over their _conciousness_, their mind, their data? How can cryptographic mechanisms help us solve this? Self hosting isn't enough, we likely need strong cryptographic protocols to secure, and optionally, prove things about our state or data.
