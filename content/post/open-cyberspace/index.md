One mustn’t look around at the current landscape and feel contentment. The time for building a truly free and open digital world is not now; but Yesterday. When they revealed to you their tactics to keep you under bird’s eyes, when they coordinated intelligences to round up protestors, when the global stage is wrought by surveillance capatlism and tyranny – you’d think you’d know what to do. We attack these at their source, hacking and deploying software that is resilient to adversarial attack, distributed to be infallible, and encrypted end-to-end to keep at bay various threat actors – from technocorps to rogues and nation-state APTs. We build anonymous transaction systems that allow people to directly opt-out of economic apparatuses that fuel the engines of war. We sew garments that trick facial recognition models, we generate proofs that computations were carried out to be verifiedly true over a string of encrypted inputs – If a user cannot afford to compute some f on their own machine, they should be able to offload it to a distributed network of machines that can compute f(x) without learning anything about the underlying x. Our call is this: Encrypt it once, and encrypt it well. For they are prying and they are selling you to a cause unknown. When mind uploads turn to reality, would you really want your memories in plaintext?
