> From Dan Boneh's [Cryptography I](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/courses/OnlineCrypto/) and the [MoonMath Manual](https://leastauthority.com/community-matters/moonmath-manual/), to [ZK Hack's Whiteboard Sessions](https://zkhack.dev/whiteboard/); and soon, the [Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.html) book by Justin Thaler. Many topics I have taken notes for already are not yet included here, as I am working on sectioning it in such a way that the material flows more intuitively; In other words, expect many changes to this document in the future.

## Discrete Probability

### Universe

Discrete probability is defined over a _universe_, denoted \\(U\\). The universe is a _finite set_, and very commonly, simply the set of all \\(n\\)-bit strings,
$$U=\lbrace 0,1 \rbrace^n.$$
It then follows that \\(U\\) has \\(2^n\\) elements, or, we could say that the cardinality of the universe \\(U\\) as defined above, is \\(2^n\\). For example, the universe \\(U=\lbrace 0,1\rbrace^2\\) is the set of all \\(2\\)-bit strings, e.g., \\(\lbrace 00,01,10,11 \rbrace\\).

### Probability Distributions

A probability distribution \\(Pr\\) over a universe \\(U\\) is a function \\(Pr:U\rightarrow[0,1]\\) such that
$$\sum_{x\in U}Pr(x)=1.$$
To say this less formally, we could say that \\(Pr\\) is a function that maps an input \\(x\in U\\) to a value ranging from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\), in such a way that the summation of all the images of \\(Pr\\) equals \\(1\\).

#### Distribution Vector

Let \\(||U||=n\\) be the cardinality of a universe \\(U\\). Because \\(U\\) is a finite set, we can represent the distribution of every element in \\(U\\) by storing the weights that the distribution assigns to every element in \\(U\\) as an \\(n\\)-vector:
$$\begin{bmatrix}
Pr(x_0) \\\\
Pr(x_1) \\\\
\vdots \\\\
Pr(x_n)
\end{bmatrix}$$

### Uniform Random Variable
Let \\(U=\lbrace 0,1 \rbrace^n\\) be some universe. We write \\(r\xleftarrow{R}U\\) to denote a ***uniform random variable*** over \\(U\\). Formally,
$$\forall a\in U,\quad Pr(r=a)=\frac{1}{||U||}.$$

## Information Theoretics

### Perfect Secrecy

Let \\(\mathcal{K}\\) be the keyspace, \\(\mathcal M\\) be the message space, and \\(\mathcal C\\) be the cipher space. A cipher \\((E,D)\\) over \\((\mathcal K,\mathcal M,\mathcal C)\\) has **perfect secrecy** if
$$\forall m_0,m_1\in\mathcal M,\quad ||m_0||=||m_1||,$$
where \\(||m_0||\\) denotes the_length of \\(m_0\\), and
$$\forall c\in\mathcal C,\quad\text{Pr}[(E(k,m_0)=c)]=\text{Pr}[(E(k,m_1)=c)],$$
where \\(k\\) is uniform and random in \\(\mathcal K\\), i.e., \\(k\xleftarrow{R}\mathcal K\\). In other words, \\((E,D)\\) has perfect secrecy if for every message \\(m_1,m_2\\) in the message space \\(\mathcal M\\), the length of \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the same, and additionality, the probability that the ciphertext \\(c\\) came from \\(m_0\\) is equal to the probability that it came from \\(m_1\\).

## Polynomials

Polynomials are algebraic expressions composed of variables, commonly referred to as indeterminates, and coefficients. These coefficients function to scale the indeterminates and must be uniformly categorized, meaning they should all belong to a specific number set, such as integers or rational numbers.

### Terminology

> _**Univariate**_ polynomials are polynomials _of one variable_. More precisely,
>
> $$P(x)=\sum_{j=0}^m a_jx^j=a_mx^m+a_{m-1}x^{m-1}+...+a_1x+a_0,$$
>
> where \\(a_j,...,a_1\\) are the coefficients, and \\(x\\) is the variable. If we let \\(R\\) denote the _type_ of the coefficients (e.g., rational, real, integer), then the set of all _univariate polynomials with coefficients in_ \\(R\\) is denoted \\(R[x]\\).

---

> ***Zero Polynomial***
>
> The _zero polynomial_ is a polynomial in which **all the coefficients are \\(0\\)**.

---

> ***One Polynomial***
>
> A polynomial is called the **one polynomial** if it is a _zero polynomial_ with the constant term (\\(a_0\\) above) of \\(1\\).

---

> ***Leading Coefficient***
>
> The **leading coefficient** is the the coefficient **of the term with the highest degree**. We denote it as follows,
> $$Lc(P)=a_m$$

### Notation

#### Degree-bounded Sets of Polynomials

It is useful to look at sets of polynomial w.r.t. their _degree_. If we, for instance, say \\(m\\) is the maximum degree allowed, we'd denote this set as \\(R^{\le m}[x]\\).
> Some other notations put the bound in the subscript, but I think it's cleaner as a superscript; helps me remember that it's a degree bound and not some sort of indexing.

### Polynomial Arithmetic
>
> "Polynomials behave like integers in many ways. In particular, they can be added, subtracted and
multiplied. In addition, they have their own notion of Euclidean Division. Informally speaking,
we can add two polynomials by simply adding the coefficients of the same index, and we can
multiply them by applying the distributive property, that is, by multiplying every term of the
left factor with every term of the right factor and adding the results together."

More formally, let \\(P(x),R(x)\in R[x]\\) be polynomials with \\(P(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{m_1}a_nx^n\\) and \\(R(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{m_2}b_nx^n\\). Then the **sum** of these polynomials is

$$\sum_{n=0}^{m_1}a_nx^n+\sum_{n=0}^{m_2}b_nx^n\implies\sum_{n=0}^{\textbf{max}(m_1,m_2)}(a_n+b_n)x^n,$$

while the **product** is defined as

$$\left(\sum_{n=0}^{m_1}a_nx^n\right)\cdot\left(\sum_{n=0}^{m_2}b_nx^n\right)\implies\sum_{n=0}^{m_1+m_2}\sum_{i=0}^n a_ib_{n-i}x^n.$$

> **Example 22: [MoonMath Manual](https://leastauthority.com/community-matters/moonmath-manual/)**
>
> To give an example of how polynomial arithmetic works, consider the following two integer polynomials \\(P,Q\in\mathbb Z[x]\\) with \\(P(x)=5x^2-4x+2\\) and \\(Q(x)=x^3-2x^2+5\\). The sum of these two polynomials is computed by adding the coefficients of each term with equal exponent in \\(x\\) (**Eq. 2**). This yields the following:
> $$\begin{align*}
> (P+Q)(x) &= (0+1)x^3+(5-2)x^2+(-4+0)x+(2+5) \\\\
> &= x^3+3x^2-4x+7.
> \end{align*}$$
> The product \\(P\cdot Q\\) is computed by multiplying each term in the first factor with each term in the second factor (**Eq. 3**). We get the following:
> \begin{align}
(P\cdot Q)(x) &= (5x^2-4x+2)\cdot(x^3-2x^2+5) \\\\
              &= (5x^5-10x^4+25x^2)+(-4x^4+8x^3-20x)+(2x^3-4x^2+10) \\\\
              &= 5x^5-14x^4+10x^3+21x^2-20x+10.
\end{align}

### Lagrange Interpolation

A neat thing about polynomials is that, for a polynomial \\(P\\) of degree \\(m\\), \\(P\\) is completely determined by its evaluation on \\(m+1\\) points. An important observation from this is that we can uniquely derive a polynomial of degree \\(m\\) from a set \\(S\\), where
$$S=\lbrace(x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1),...,(x_m,y_m)\space|\space x_i\ne x_j\text{ for all indices }i\text{ and }j\rbrace.$$

In other words, polynomials have the property that given \\(m+1\\) pairs of points \\(x_i,y_i\\) for \\(x_i\ne x_j\\) are enough to determine the set of pairs \\((x,P(x)),\space\forall x\in R\\).

> #### *Important
>
> If you want to find a polynomial that fits a given set of points--and if its coefficients have a multiplicative inverse--you can use the **Lagrange Interpolation** method. This technique allows you to derive a polynomial \\(P\\) of degree \\(m\\) where \\(P(x_i)=y_i,\space\forall (x_i,y_i)\in S\\).

## Finite (Galois) Fields

Finite fields are used extensively in modern cryptography. This is due to them possessing characteristics that make performing certain operations within them easy. But what even is a field? Why do we restrict them to being _finite_? What's useful about them?

### On Terminology

The term _Finite Field_ is sometimes referred to as a _Galois Field_, after [Ã‰variste Galois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois); a french mathematician who made enormous contributions to mathematics in his short 20 year life.

> These terms are interchangable, though we will opt to use the term _Galois Field_ (GF) in what follows to give credit where credit is due.

### Fields

The term _field_ is just a fancy way of denoting a **set** on which the ordinary operations of _addition_, _subtraction_, _multiplication_, and _division_ are defined. In fact, you are already familiar with (at least) a couple fields! For instance, the set of all real numbers \\(\mathbb R\\) forms a field; and likewise, so does the set of all rational numbers, \\(\mathbb Q\\). These operations are undoubtably defined on these sets, so we call them _fields_.

So why doesn't the set of integers \\(\mathbb Z\\) constitue a field? Well, more formally--to be classified as a field--the set must satisfy the following properties:

1. ***Associativity of addition and multiplication***

* \\(\forall a,b,c\in\mathbb F\\):
  $$a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$$
  $$a\cdot(b\cdot c)=(a\cdot b)\cdot c$$

2. ***Commutativity of addition and multiplication***

* \\(\forall a,b,c\in\mathbb F\\):
  $$a+b=b+a$$
  $$a\cdot b=b\cdot a$$

3. ***Left-distributivity***

* \\(\forall a,b,c\in\mathbb F\\)
  $$a\cdot(b+c)=a\cdot b+a\cdot c$$

4. ***Existence of additive identity***

* \\(\exists i\in\mathbb F\\) such that
  $$\forall a\in\mathbb F,\quad a+i=a$$

5. ***Existence of a multiplicative identity***

* \\(\exists e\in\mathbb F\\) such that \\(e\ne0\\) and
  $$\forall a\in\mathbb F,\quad ae=a$$

6. _**Existence of additive inverse**_ (often denoted as \\(-a\\))

* \\(\forall a\in\mathbb F,\exists b\in\mathbb F\\) such that
  $$a+b=0$$

7. _**Existence of multiplicative inverse**_ (often denoted as \\(a^{-1}\\))

* \\(\forall a\in\mathbb F\\) where \\(a\ne0\\), \\(\exists b\in\mathbb F\\) such that
  $$a\cdot b=1$$

We can pretty clearly see that \\(\mathbb Z\\) satisfies _most_ of these properties. But it is missing one important one: _existence of a multiplicative inverse_. Because \\(\mathbb Z\\) is restricted to only _whole_ numbers, it's trivial to see that \\(\mathbb Z\\) does not satisfy this property, and therfore, does not constitue a field.
